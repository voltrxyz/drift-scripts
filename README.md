## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of TypeScript scripts demonstrating basic interactions with Voltr Vaults on the Solana blockchain. They cover core functionalities like initializing and managing vaults, depositing and withdrawing assets for users, and querying vault/user state.

These scripts serve as a starting point and example for building more complex integrations with the Voltr protocol.

---

## Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js v18+**
    Ensure you have Node.js version 18 or higher installed.

2.  **pnpm**
    This project uses pnpm for package management. Install it if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```
    Or see the [pnpm website](https://pnpm.io/installation).

3.  **Solana Keypairs**
    You'll need separate Solana keypair files (in JSON format) for the following roles:
    *   **Admin:** Manages vault configuration and fee harvesting.
    *   **Manager:** Designated during vault initialization (role specified by Voltr protocol, used in init/harvest).
    *   **User:** Interacts with the vault (deposit/withdraw).

    Store these JSON files securely on your filesystem.

4.  **Solana RPC URL**
    A reliable Solana RPC endpoint URL is required. The scripts are configured to use a Helius RPC URL provided via an environment variable, but any compatible RPC should work.

---

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url> voltr-base-scripts
    cd voltr-base-scripts
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

---

## Configuration

Configuration requires setting environment variables and editing the `config/base.ts` file.

### Environment Variables (Required)

These scripts expect the following environment variables to be set, pointing to your keypair files and RPC URL:

*   `ADMIN_FILE_PATH`: Absolute path to the Admin keypair JSON file.
*   `MANAGER_FILE_PATH`: Absolute path to the Manager keypair JSON file.
*   `USER_FILE_PATH`: Absolute path to the User keypair JSON file.
*   `HELIUS_RPC_URL`: Your Solana RPC endpoint URL.

**Example (using .env file or exporting):**

```bash
export ADMIN_FILE_PATH="/path/to/your/admin.json"
export MANAGER_FILE_PATH="/path/to/your/manager.json"
export USER_FILE_PATH="/path/to/your/user.json"
export HELIUS_RPC_URL="https://your-rpc-provider-url"
```

**Security Note:** Never commit your private key JSON files to version control. Keep them secure and use environment variables or a secure secrets management system.

### Configuration File (`config/base.ts`)

This file contains parameters for vault operations. You **must** edit this file before running scripts.

*   **Vault Initialization (Needed for `admin-init-vault.ts`)**
    *   `vaultConfig`: An object defining parameters like `maxCap`, fees (`managerPerformanceFee`, `adminPerformanceFee`, etc.), `lockedProfitDegradationDuration`, `redemptionFee`, `issuanceFee`, `withdrawalWaitingPeriod`.
    *   `vaultParams`: Contains `vaultConfig` and basic metadata like `name`, `description`.

*   **Core Vault Details**
    *   `assetMintAddress`: **Required.** The public key (string) of the token mint that will be deposited into the vault (e.g., USDC, SOL).
    *   `assetTokenProgram`: **Required.** The public key (string) of the SPL Token program governing the `assetMintAddress` (e.g., `Tokenkeg...` for SPL Token, `Tokenz...` for Token-2022).
    *   `vaultAddress`: **Required after initialization.** Leave empty initially. After running `admin-init-vault.ts`, paste the outputted vault public key here.

*   **Transaction Optimization (Optional)**
    *   `useLookupTable`: Boolean. Set to `true` to create and use an Address Lookup Table (LUT) during initialization for potentially cheaper transactions.
    *   `lookupTableAddress`: **Required if `useLookupTable` is true.** Leave empty initially. After running `admin-init-vault.ts` with `useLookupTable: true`, paste the outputted LUT public key here.

*   **Action Parameters (Needed for deposit/withdraw scripts)**
    *   `depositAmountVault`: The amount of the base asset (in its smallest unit, e.g., lamports for SOL, 10^6 for USDC) to deposit.
    *   `withdrawAmountVault`: The amount to withdraw. Interpretation depends on `isWithdrawInLp`.
    *   `isWithdrawAll`: Boolean. If `true`, attempts to withdraw the user's entire position, overriding `withdrawAmountVault`.
    *   `isWithdrawInLp`: Boolean. If `true`, `withdrawAmountVault` is interpreted as the amount of *LP tokens* to withdraw. If `false`, it's interpreted as the amount of the *underlying asset* to withdraw.

---

## Available Scripts

Run scripts using `pnpm ts-node <script_path>`. Ensure environment variables are set and `config/base.ts` is updated appropriately for the script you are running.

### Admin Scripts

*   **`src/scripts/admin-init-vault.ts`**
    *   Initializes a new Voltr vault using the Admin as payer and designates the Manager.
    *   Requires `vaultConfig`, `vaultParams`, `assetMintAddress`, `assetTokenProgram` in `base.ts`.
    *   Outputs the new `vaultAddress` and `lookupTableAddress` (if `useLookupTable` is true). **You must update `base.ts` with these values after running.**
    *   Uses `ADMIN_FILE_PATH` and `MANAGER_FILE_PATH`.

*   **`src/scripts/admin-update-vault.ts`**
    *   Updates the configuration (`vaultConfig`) of an existing vault.
    *   Requires `vaultAddress` and the desired `vaultConfig` in `base.ts`.
    *   Uses `ADMIN_FILE_PATH`.

*   **`src/scripts/admin-harvest-fee.ts`**
    *   Collects accumulated performance and protocol fees from the vault, distributing them to Admin, Manager, and Protocol Admin.
    *   Requires `vaultAddress` in `base.ts`.
    *   Uses `ADMIN_FILE_PATH` and `MANAGER_FILE_PATH`.

### User Scripts

*   **`src/scripts/user-deposit-vault.ts`**
    *   Deposits a specified amount (`depositAmountVault`) of the vault's asset token from the User's account into the vault, receiving LP tokens in return.
    *   Handles wSOL wrapping/unwrapping if `assetMintAddress` is the native SOL mint.
    *   Requires `vaultAddress`, `assetMintAddress`, `assetTokenProgram`, `depositAmountVault` in `base.ts`.
    *   Uses `USER_FILE_PATH`.

*   **`src/scripts/user-request-withdraw-vault.ts`**
    *   Initiates a withdrawal request for the User. Fails if another request is pending.
    *   Uses `withdrawAmountVault`, `isWithdrawInLp`, `isWithdrawAll` from `base.ts`.
    *   Requires `vaultAddress` in `base.ts`.
    *   Uses `USER_FILE_PATH`.

*   **`src/scripts/user-withdraw-vault.ts`**
    *   Completes a previously requested withdrawal after any waiting period has passed. Fails if no request was made or the waiting period isn't over.
    *   Handles wSOL unwrapping if necessary.
    *   Requires `vaultAddress`, `assetMintAddress`, `assetTokenProgram` in `base.ts`.
    *   Uses `USER_FILE_PATH`.

    *   Uses `withdrawAmountVault`, `isWithdrawInLp`, `isWithdrawAll` from `base.ts`.
    *   Requires `vaultAddress`, `assetMintAddress`, `assetTokenProgram` in `base.ts`.
    *   Uses `USER_FILE_PATH`.

### Query Scripts

*   **`src/scripts/user-query-position.ts`**
    *   Fetches the User's current LP token balance and calculates the approximate equivalent value in the underlying vault asset (both before and after potential withdrawal fees/degradation).
    *   Requires `vaultAddress` in `base.ts`.
    *   Uses `USER_FILE_PATH`.

*   **`src/scripts/query-strategy-positions.ts`**
    *   Fetches the vault account data, displays the total asset value, and lists any initialized strategy allocations (showing strategy address and position value).
    *   Requires `vaultAddress` in `base.ts`.
    *   Uses `ADMIN_FILE_PATH` (implicitly via RPC connection, though no signing needed).

## Basic Usage Flow

1.  **Configure Environment:** Set the `ADMIN_FILE_PATH`, `MANAGER_FILE_PATH`, `USER_FILE_PATH`, and `HELIUS_RPC_URL` environment variables.
2.  **Configure Vault Parameters:** Edit `config/base.ts`. Fill in `vaultConfig`, `vaultParams`, `assetMintAddress`, `assetTokenProgram`. Decide on `useLookupTable`. Leave `vaultAddress` and `lookupTableAddress` empty for now.
3.  **Initialize Vault (Admin):**
    ```bash
    pnpm ts-node src/scripts/admin-init-vault.ts
    ```
4.  **Update Config:** Copy the outputted `Vault:` and `Lookup Table:` (if used) addresses and paste them into the `vaultAddress` and `lookupTableAddress` fields in `config/base.ts`.
5.  **Update Vault (Admin, Optional):** If you need to change config after init:
    ```bash
    pnpm ts-node src/scripts/admin-update-vault.ts
    ```
6.  **Deposit (User):** Set `depositAmountVault` in `config/base.ts`.
    ```bash
    pnpm ts-node src/scripts/user-deposit-vault.ts
    ```
7.  **Check Position (User):**
    ```bash
    pnpm ts-node src/scripts/user-query-position.ts
    ```
8.  **Withdraw (User):** Set withdrawal parameters (`withdrawAmountVault`, `isWithdrawInLp`, `isWithdrawAll`) in `config/base.ts`.
    *   **If `withdrawalWaitingPeriod` > 0:**
        ```bash
        # Step 1: Request
        pnpm ts-node src/scripts/user-request-withdraw-vault.ts
        # Step 2: Wait for the period, then withdraw
        pnpm ts-node src/scripts/user-withdraw-vault.ts
        ```
    *   **If `withdrawalWaitingPeriod` == 0:**
        ```bash
        pnpm ts-node src/scripts/user-request-and-withdraw-vault.ts
        ```
9.  **Harvest Fees (Admin):**
    ```bash
    pnpm ts-node src/scripts/admin-harvest-fee.ts
    ```
10. **Query Strategies (Admin/General):**
    ```bash
    pnpm ts-node src/scripts/query-strategy-positions.ts

## Drift Strategy Extensions (voltr-drift-scripts)

The following sections detail the additions specific to the `voltr-drift-scripts` project, which builds upon the base functionality to include Drift spot market strategy interactions.

### Additional Configuration (`config/drift.ts`)

This file complements `config/base.ts` and holds parameters specific to the Drift strategy.

- **Strategy Action Parameters:**

  - `depositStrategyAmount`: **Required.** The amount of the **vault's base asset** (defined in `config/base.ts`) to deposit into the Drift strategy, denominated in the smallest units of the base asset (e.g., 1,000,000 for 1 USDC).
  - `withdrawStrategyAmount`: **Required.** The amount of the **vault's base asset** to withdraw from the Drift strategy, denominated in the smallest units of the base asset.

- **Drift Variables:**
  - `driftMarketIndex`: **Required.** The numerical index of the Drift spot market to interact with (e.g., `DRIFT.SPOT.USDC.MARKET_INDEX`). Ensure this aligns with the vault's `assetMintAddress` from `config/base.ts`, as **no automatic swaps** are performed by these scripts. Refer to `src/constants/drift.ts` for available market indices and their corresponding assets.

### New Admin Script

- **`src/scripts/admin-add-adaptor.ts`**
  - **Purpose:** Enables the vault to use Drift strategies by adding the official Voltr Drift Adaptor program (`ADAPTOR_PROGRAM_ID` found in `src/constants/drift.ts`) to the vault's list of approved adaptors. This only needs to be run once per vault.
  - **Requires:** `vaultAddress` (from `config/base.ts`).
  - **Uses:** `ADMIN_FILE_PATH`. May update the vault's LUT if `useLookupTable` is true.

### New Manager Scripts

These scripts are executed by the vault's designated Manager.

- **`src/scripts/manager-init-user.ts`**

  - **Purpose:** Initializes the necessary on-chain accounts for the vault to interact with the Drift protocol via the Voltr Drift Adaptor. This creates the Voltr strategy account PDA, the Drift user account PDA (tied to the vault's strategy authority), and associated token accounts. This only needs to be run once per vault.
  - **Requires:** `vaultAddress`, `assetMintAddress`, `assetTokenProgram` (from `config/base.ts`). Also requires Drift constants like `DRIFT.PROGRAM_ID`, `DRIFT.SPOT.STATE`, `DRIFT.SUB_ACCOUNT_ID`, and the `ADAPTOR_PROGRAM_ID` from `src/constants/drift.ts`. The vault's `name` from `config/base.ts` `vaultParams` is used internally.
  - **Outputs:** Logs the transaction signature upon successful initialization.
  - **Uses:** `MANAGER_FILE_PATH`. May update the vault's LUT if `useLookupTable` is true.

- **`src/scripts/manager-deposit-user.ts`**

  - **Purpose:** Deposits funds _from_ the vault _into_ the initialized Drift strategy, specifically depositing into the spot market defined by `driftMarketIndex`.
  - **No Swaps:** This script **does not perform swaps**. It assumes the vault's `assetMintAddress` (from `config/base.ts`) is the correct asset for the specified `driftMarketIndex` (in `config/drift.ts`).
  - **Requires:** `vaultAddress`, `assetMintAddress`, `assetTokenProgram`, `lookupTableAddress` (if used) from `config/base.ts`. Also requires `depositStrategyAmount`, `driftMarketIndex` from `config/drift.ts`, and relevant Drift constants and PDAs (derived internally, utilizes `@drift-labs/sdk` for remaining accounts).
  - **Uses:** `MANAGER_FILE_PATH`.

- **`src/scripts/manager-withdraw-user.ts`**
  - **Purpose:** Withdraws funds _from_ the Drift strategy (specifically the spot market defined by `driftMarketIndex`) _back into_ the main vault account.
  - **No Swaps:** This script **does not perform swaps**. The withdrawn asset is assumed to be the vault's base asset.
  - **Requires:** `vaultAddress`, `assetMintAddress`, `assetTokenProgram`, `lookupTableAddress` (if used) from `config/base.ts`. Also requires `withdrawStrategyAmount`, `driftMarketIndex` from `config/drift.ts`, and relevant Drift constants and PDAs (derived internally, utilizes `@drift-labs/sdk` for remaining accounts).
  - **Uses:** `MANAGER_FILE_PATH`.

### Drift Strategy Flow

This outlines the typical sequence for setting up and managing the Drift strategy:

1.  **Complete Basic Vault Setup:** Follow steps 1-4 in the [Basic Usage Flow](#basic-usage-flow) to initialize the vault and configure `config/base.ts`. Ensure `assetMintAddress` matches the Drift market you intend to use (e.g., USDC).
2.  **Configure Drift Parameters:** Edit `config/drift.ts`. Define `depositStrategyAmount`, `withdrawStrategyAmount`, and crucially, the correct `driftMarketIndex` corresponding to your vault's asset.
3.  **Add Drift Adaptor (Admin):** Run `pnpm ts-node src/scripts/admin-add-adaptor.ts` to authorize the vault to use the Drift adaptor.
4.  **Initialize Drift User Strategy (Manager):** Run `pnpm ts-node src/scripts/manager-init-user.ts` to set up the on-chain accounts for Drift interaction.
5.  **Ensure Vault has Funds:** Use `user-deposit-vault.ts` (as the User) if the vault needs funds.
6.  **Deposit into Drift Strategy (Manager):** Run `pnpm ts-node src/scripts/manager-deposit-user.ts` to allocate funds from the vault to the specified Drift spot market.
7.  **Query Positions:** Use `query-strategy-positions.ts` to see the updated allocation in the Drift strategy.
8.  **(Optional) Withdraw from Drift Strategy (Manager):** Run `pnpm ts-node src/scripts/manager-withdraw-user.ts` to bring funds back from the Drift spot market into the vault.
9.  **(Optional) User Withdrawal:** Users can withdraw from the vault as usual using the `user-*` withdrawal scripts. The vault program handles interactions with the strategy if necessary.

### Protocol Integration Details

- **Drift Protocol:** The scripts interact with the Drift Protocol's spot markets via the Voltr Drift Adaptor (`EBN9...`). The necessary program IDs, state accounts, and market indices are defined in `src/constants/drift.ts`. The manager scripts (`manager-deposit-user`, `manager-withdraw-user`) utilize the `@drift-labs/sdk` to correctly format instructions and gather necessary remaining accounts for interacting with Drift.
- **No Swaps:** It's critical to understand that these scripts assume the vault's base asset (`assetMintAddress` in `config/base.ts`) directly corresponds to the asset of the `driftMarketIndex` chosen in `config/drift.ts`. No automatic asset conversion (swapping) is implemented.
